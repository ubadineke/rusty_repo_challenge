# 30 Day Rust Challenge

Welcome to my rigorous journey through Rust, Data Structures, Algorithms, Systems Programming, and Advanced Engineering concepts. This challenge is designed cover a vast spectrum of topics from basic programming to cutting-edge system architectures.

## Prerequisites

- **Basic Rust Syntax**: Familiarity with Rust's syntax, ownership model, and basic programming constructs.
- **Cargo**: Comfortable with creating and managing Rust projects.
- **Data Structures**: Understanding of arrays, vectors, strings, and basic algorithms.
- **Programming Fundamentals**: Strong grasp of programming concepts.
- **Command Line & Git**: Basic proficiency in using command line tools and version control.
- **Distributed Systems**: Preliminary knowledge of distributed system principles.

## Program Philosophy

This challenge merges two educational paths:

1. **Rust and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** - Mastery of Rust-specific features, memory safety, and algorithm implementation.
2. **Advanced Engineering** - Dive into modern backend, distributed systems, blockchain, and performance optimization.

## Structure

- **Daily Challenges**: Each day includes 7-10 tasks of increasing complexity.
- **Focus Areas**
  - Rust-specific optimizations
  - Systems programming
  - Concurrency and parallelism
  - Backend architecture
  - Distributed systems and blockchain

## Daily Breakdown

**Day 1 to Day 30**: Each day's tasks are listed in a dedicated file, `DAY_X/README.md`, where X represents the day number. These files detail:

- **Basic Data Structures**
- **Advanced Data Structures**
- **Graph Algorithms**
- **String and Bit Manipulation**
- **Network and System Programming**
- **Database Systems**
- **Blockchain and Consensus Mechanisms**
- **Concurrency and Parallelism**
- **Security and Performance Optimization**

## How to Use This Repository

### 1. Fork or Clone

Clone this repository to your local machine or fork it to your own GitHub account for modifications:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/donjne/rusty_repo.git
```

### 2. Setup Rust Environment

Install Rust:
If you haven't installed Rust yet, use the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Update the Rust Toolchain:
Ensure you have the latest version:

```bash
rustup update
```

### 3. Daily Routine

Read the Instructions:
Open the DAY_X.md file to review the tasks for the day.

Implement the Tasks:
Create a new Rust project or add tasks to an existing project using Cargo:

```bash
cargo new task_name
```

```bash
cd task_name
```

Follow best practices while writing Rust code.

Test Your Code:
Write unit tests for your implementations. Run tests using:

```bash
cargo test
```

Document Your Code:
Add comments to explain complex parts or optimizations. Use /// for documentation comments and generate docs using:

```bash
cargo doc --open
```

### 4. Submit Your Work

Push to Your Fork:
Save your work to your GitHub repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Day X: Implemented tasks"
git push origin master
```

Use Branches for Each Day:
Keep your repository organized by using branches:

```bash
git checkout -b day_X
git add .
git commit -m "Day X: Implemented tasks"
git push origin day_X
```

### 5. Review and Learn

Compare your implementation with reference solutions (if provided).
Engage in discussions with the Rust community or your learning group to get feedback.
Reflect on what youâ€™ve learned and identify areas for improvement.

## Contribution Guidelines

Issues:
Report bugs, suggest improvements, or discuss ideas in the Issues section.

Pull Requests:
Propose changes or submit new challenges. Ensure they align with the challenge's goals.

## Code Style

Follow Rust's standards. Use rustfmt for consistent formatting:

```bash
cargo fmt
```

## Acknowledgements

Rust Community: For providing an exceptional ecosystem and learning resources.
Contributors: For shaping this challenge and adding value to the learning journey.

## Final Project

On the last day, integrate your learning into a comprehensive project. The final project should demonstrate:

Documentation: Detailed architecture and design decisions.
Performance: Benchmarks and optimization reports.
Security: A security audit checklist.
Scalability: Evidence of scalability testing.
Recovery: Strategies for failure recovery.
Monitoring: Implementation of observability tools.
Embark on this journey to not just learn Rust, but master the art of engineering with it! ðŸš€

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```css
30-day-rust-challenge/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ day_one/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ task_01_stack/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.rs
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ task_02_queue/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.rs
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ day_two/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ task_01_circular_buffer/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.rs
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

In this structure, day_one, day_two, etc., are folders for each day's tasks.
Inside each day's folder, you will find subfolders for individual tasks (e.g., task_01_stack, task_02_queue).
Each task has its own Rust project with Cargo.toml and src/main.rs.
A README.md file for each day to guide you through the tasks.
