# Task: Implement a Stack Data Structure in Rust

## Task Description

You're tasked to implement a basic stack data structure in Rust, which supports the following operations:

1. **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop**: Removes and returns the element at the top of the stack.
3. **Peek**: Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
4. **IsEmpty**: Checks if the stack is empty.
5. **Size**: Returns the number of elements in the stack.

The implementation must support generic types, so the stack should be able to hold elements of any type (e.g., integers, strings, etc.).

Additionally, write unit tests to verify the correctness of the stack operations.
